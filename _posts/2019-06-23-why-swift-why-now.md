Im currently working as an experienced full stack web developer, who has dabbled with iOS development in the past (back in the stitched leather days), and as somebody who uses Apple products and has a general interest in technology, I’ve always kept one eye on the Apple developer ecosystem.

That includes watching WWDC each year to see Apple lay out its plans for the next release of its operating systems and enables us to read the tea leaves about the long term future of those platforms.

The leaves couldn’t have been more clear this year, this is the start of a big shift for development on all Apple’s platforms, current and future. With Apple continuing to advance powerful frameworks such as Core ML, ARKit and SiriKit, plus introducing brand new frameworks including SwiftUI and Combine that completely change the paradigms used to build apps, now is an exciting and fun time to jump into Swift development.
